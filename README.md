## Tutorial 3

One distance sensor mounted back side of automotive application. Develop an Arduino sketch to do following:
If distance is less then 30 cm then sound the buzzer.

Learning Outcome: Here in above learn to develop a mini project in which using ultrasonic sensor define a perticular range in which any object come then buzzer sound start.
